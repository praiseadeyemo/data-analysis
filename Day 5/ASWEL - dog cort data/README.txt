Intro to R (Day 5) - ASWEL: Dog cort

There are 40 dogs in a kennel of both sexes (1 = females, 2 = males) and they are randomly distributed over rooms that can be access by visitors (treatment = 2) and other rooms that are not disturbed (treatment = 1). Saliva samples were taken to analyse for cortisol concentration (measure unit nmol/l). The samples were early in the day (between 2 and 8am, before visitors arrive and dogs were rested and had no disturbances from any daily routines) and saliva samples for each dog were taken twice one week apart (Week 1 and 2).

Start by importing the .csv file and by getting familiar with the different variables included, the list of which is explained below.

Then you should explore and discuss as a group:

- which variable should be your response or outcome variable? (i.e. what question could be best answered with these data?)

- what predictor variables in the data might explain this outcome variable? You should select only some of the variables provided - which ones do you think will be most informative and relevant for your question?

Once you have identified a question or a hypothesis as well as a possible approach for answering it, you are ready to work on:

- visual data exploration:
    - how is your response variable related to different predictor variables?
    - to what extent do different variables correlate with each other?

- setting up one or more statistical analyses using a generalised linear model (glm) or a generalised linear mixed model (glmm) with multiple predictors: what model family is required for these data? (you might not have covered this yet in the Advanced Stats class, ok to ask for help!)

- a brief conclusion informed by your analysis.
